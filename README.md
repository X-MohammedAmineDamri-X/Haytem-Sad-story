# Haytem-Sad-story

One day, Haitem walked into the café smiling, and everyone suddenly stopped eating… because his gums were shinier than the tableware.

Me: “Bro, your mouth looks like it’s permanently on airplane mode — no connection between food and chewing.”

He ordered a steak… without realizing he was basically about to commit dental suicide. I swear, the way he was gumming that meat, even the steak started feeling uncomfortable.

Haitem: “It’s tender, I can eat it.”
Me: “Tender? Bro, that steak is filing a police report for harassment.”

Later, he tried to whistle for a taxi. All I heard was air escaping like a flat tire.
Me: “Man, with no teeth, your mouth is basically a flute with emotional damage.”

And don’t even get me started on him eating chips… He doesn’t bite them, he negotiates with them until they soften in his mouth.

By the end of the day, Haitem smiled again, and I realized… his gums aren’t just gums — they’re like two pink airbags keeping him safe from the dangers of chewing.
